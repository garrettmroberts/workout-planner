## User Story

AS a busy fitness enthusiast  
I WANT an app that will quickly and efficiently create a workout schedule  
SO THAT I can spend the time saved on more important things.

## About

This app allows a user to create a login and save their fitness goals and available workout equipment.  The app will then generate a 2-month workout for the user using these parameters.  On each visit, the page will update to show the user's next upcoming workout.
